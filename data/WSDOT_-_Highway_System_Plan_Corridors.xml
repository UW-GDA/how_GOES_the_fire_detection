            <abstract>WSDOT's Corridor Sketch Initiative is a set of planning activities that engages the agency's partners to determine the context and performance of state highway corridors and identify high-level strategies for addressing performance gaps. The initiative complements and supports regional planning processes around the state and serves as the foundation for practical solutions and integrated scoping. WSDOT uses the results of the Corridor Sketch Initiative to determine where the agency should do more in depth planning and analysis. For more information on the Corridor Sketch Initiative, go to https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/planning-guidance/planning-study-guidance/corridor-sketch-initiative. WSDOT divided the state's highway system into 304 functional segments that serve communities, economic regions and regional networks. The agency considered traffic characteristics, Freight and Goods Transportation System classification, access management, roadway characteristics, seasonal closures, land use, and proximity to intermodal centers such as ports or transit centers.</abstract>
            <purpose>This layer displays the geographic extent of the 304 corridors that make up the statewide highway system. This does not include ferry routes. The attributes provide information on mobility performance gaps by corridor as well as which corridors have published corridor sketch summary documents. This layer can be used to locate further information about the corridors through the summary documents or to compare corridor extents to other spatial data.</purpose>
            <supplinf>WSDOT started work on the Corridor Sketch Initiative in 2015. This phase of the initiative involved breaking up the state highway system into functional corridors, screening the system for congestion, and working with the agency's regional planning offices and partners to collect baseline information which was entered into a database. The next phase of the initiative involved an extensive engagement process with partners across the state to verify performance gaps identified in WSDOT's screen and collaboratively identify root causes of, as well as potential strategies to address, those gaps. The agency is compiling this information into summary documents. Links to published summaries are aviailable through this layer or at https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/planning-guidance/planning-study-guidance/corridor-sketch-initiative The range of the data is 2015-2017. More specifically, the percent congested data is from 2015. Tthe information in the summaries is from 2016-2017. The Summary URL links are current.</supplinf>

                <procdesc>All data was imported to a geodatabase table format from a CSV file. Data was collected from multiple sources into the CSV file including an Access database and excel workbooks. The table was then joined with a feature with the extent of the corridors based on the attribute CorridorID. All calculations were done outside of GIS. The tabular data comes from an Access database. Particularly CorridorID, CorridorName, RegionName, and RegionOrgName. The PercentCongested data was also stored in the access database and comes from the 2016 mobility screen conducted for the corridor sketch initiative. This screen used mainly the Highway Segment Analysis Program but also other datasets like the National Performance Research Dataset (NPMRDS) from HERE. Summary URLs come from WSDOTâ€™s corridor sketch website</procdesc>
